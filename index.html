          500 Internal is the corner of the internet with silly puns, tech, art updates and more. Please see the footer to see the "secret" Github to stay up to date with interesting projects that may not always be on 500 Internal

            Our goal is to have fun on the internet and show you interesting tools and resources that may help you (more than AI).

            We still strive to be as secure as possible. This as uploaded via a Linux device. I am not a pro, but I ran <strong>sudo chkrootkit</strong> to ensure that aren't any rootkits upon uploading this. Our device is 99% safe from scans by adjusting the firewall rules and blocking unecessary ports. Please do your own research on any code or tools that we may use or promote. We only share vetted information used to better humanity and lighten you up. 500 Internal is an obvious play on words. We may need coffee at times!</strong>
